            <h2>PEB STRUCTURE </h2>
            <p>AID’s sister company Pari Engineering have been in installation of PEB structure for past 7 years working PAN India 
              basis. Our structural members are custom designed to be lighter in weight as well as high in strength. For today and 
              in the future, AID has become the material of choice in building construction, compared to concrete and timber. Our 
              building designs have become more flexible, durable, and adaptable. PEB is a structure built over a structural concept 
              of primary members, secondary members, and the cover sheeting connected to each other. Pre-Engineered
              Buildings can be fitted with different structural additions like trusses, mezzanine floors, fascia’s, canopies and crane 
              systems as per user requirements. Pre-Engineered Buildings are ideal for use in non-residential, wide span low rise 
              buildings. Among the advantages of PEB is low cost, consistent quality control, and fast delivery to name a few. PEB 
              buildings are used for diverse applications such as factories, warehouses, offices, shopping malls, schools, hospitals, 
              community buildings and several more.
